# SMB Mount Manager

Small GTK app for creating SMB mounts that come back on startup.

The app checks the host, asks for credentials, tests the mount, then creates a
systemd mount unit. Managed shares are mounted under:

```text
/mnt/mount-manager
```

Credentials and app metadata are stored under:

```text
/etc/mount-manager
```

## Requirements

systemd 258 or newer with `systemd-creds` available. The app refuses to start
on older systems.

Credentials are always stored encrypted via `systemd-creds` and decrypted by
systemd at unit start, exposed to `mount.cifs` through `LoadCredentialEncrypted=`.
The plaintext password never touches disk, and the encrypted blob is bound to
the host so it cannot be decrypted on a different machine.

Encrypted credential files live in `/etc/mount-manager/credentials/` as
`<id>.cred.enc`.

## Test as an installed app on Bazzite

From the repository root, enable a transient `/usr` overlay:

```bash
sudo rpm-ostree usroverlay
```

Install the app files into the overlay:

```bash
sudo install -D -m 0755 mount_manager.py /usr/bin/mount-manager
sudo install -D -m 0644 data/applications/io.github.ublue_os.mount-manager.desktop /usr/share/applications/io.github.ublue_os.mount-manager.desktop
sudo install -D -m 0644 data/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/io.github.ublue_os.mount-manager.svg /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/io.github.ublue_os.mount-manager.svg
sudo install -D -m 0644 data/metainfo/io.github.ublue_os.mount-manager.metainfo.xml /usr/share/metainfo/io.github.ublue_os.mount-manager.metainfo.xml
```

Refresh desktop and icon caches:

```bash
sudo update-desktop-database /usr/share/applications
sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor
```

Run the installed desktop entry:

```bash
mount-manager
```

As the overlay is temporary its cleaned up just by rebooting.
